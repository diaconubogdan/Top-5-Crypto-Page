Very basic application for displaying top 5 cryptocurrencies  
![alt demo](https://image.prntscr.com/image/FZ0hcNxHTeuLrbwWbZvzHA.png)  
API Used: https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/?limit=5  
Got crypto images from here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/cryptocurrency-icons/tree/master/32/black. Probably overkill. Also, broken images may be displayed if a cryptocurrency gets in top5 and the symbol image is not there. But that is very unlikely  
Used vue2-filters to display the price and the market cap nicely.
